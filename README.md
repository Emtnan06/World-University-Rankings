# World University Rankings

## üîç Introduction

### **Problem Statement:**
Analyzing global university rankings data to answer the following questions:  
1. Which universities are ranked in the **top 10 globally**?  
2. Which universities are ranked in the **top 10 for employment outcomes**?  
3. What positions do **Saudi Arabian universities** hold within the global rankings?  
4. Considering various factors such as employment rankings, research rankings, and others, which has the **most significant impact** on a university‚Äôs overall ranking?  
5. Is there a **correlation between national and global university rankings**? Based on this, can we recommend a country with a high concentration of **top-ranked universities**?  


##  üìä **Dataset Overview**  
- The datasets provided to us were all from 2023, except for Shanghai, which was from 2022. To maintain timeliness, we worked on **Shanghai 2023** after confirming that they used the same **evaluation criteria, weights, and methodology** in both years.  
- **Source:** The dataset was sourced from [World University Rankings - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ourfuture/world-university-rankings), and each ranking's credibility was verified.  
- **Ranking Methodologies:**  
  - **Shanghai Ranking (ARWU)**: Uses objective indicators like **Nobel laureates** and **highly cited researchers**.  
  - **CWUR (Center for World University Rankings)**: Focuses on **faculty achievements, research output, and alumni success**, avoiding reputation surveys.  
  - **Times Higher Education Ranking**: Balances **teaching, research, industry income, and international outlook**, using verified university data and independent sources like Elsevier‚Äôs **Scopus**.  
  - Their **transparent methodologies** ensure **reliability** in assessing global universities.  

- **Key Differences in Ranking Approaches:**  
  - The **World Ranking dataset** and the **Shanghai dataset** rank universities based on **academic performance**.  
  - The **Times ranking**, however, focuses on **impact** and evaluates **17 different criteria**.  
  - The **first two rankings** use **four main criteria** with different weightings, whereas **Shanghai** further divides these into **six sub-criteria**.  

- **Additional Source:** The Shanghai dataset specifically comes from [Shanghai World University Rankings 2023 - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neellad3110/shanghai-world-university-rankings-2023).  

- **Ranking Methodologies Breakdown:**  
  - **Times Ranking**:  
    - Assigned **individual ranks** to the **top 100 universities**.  
    - Universities ranked **101‚Äì200** were grouped together.  
    - Subsequent groups were in **increments of 200**, with universities beyond **1001+** labeled as **1001+**.  
  - **Shanghai Ranking**:  
    - Assigned **specific ranks** for the **top 100** universities.  
    - Universities beyond the top 100 were grouped in **increments of 50**, then **increments of 100**.  
  - **World Ranking**:  
    - Assigned a **unique numerical rank** to **each university** from the **first to the last**.  



## üîç **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **The following steps were applied to the dataset:**
1. **Data Quality Checking & Remediation:**
   - **Data Cleaning:**  
     - Handling missing/null values and correcting errors.
     - Addressing non-standard entries in ranking fields (e.g., '-' and '.').
   - **Standardization:**  
     - Creating functions to standardize the format of university names.
datasets.
   - **Outlier Handling:**  
     - Identifying and addressing outliers when necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - **Univariate Analysis:**  
     - Understanding the distribution of individual variables (e.g., Scores, World Rank).
   - **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:**  
     - Investigating relationships between variables (e.g., how individual ranking metrics relate to overall performance).
3. **Data Visualizations:**
   - **Over 10 different charts** created using:
     - **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
   - **Unified Style Guidelines:**  
     - Consistent colors, titles, font sizes, axis labels, and legends across all charts.

## üí° **Conclusion**
Our analysis revealed that U.S. universities dominate global rankings, with Harvard, Stanford, and MIT consistently securing top positions due to their strong research output, faculty achievements, and academic excellence. Employability rankings, however, show a more diverse distribution, with universities from France, Japan, and Australia performing strongly. Saudi universities are gaining recognition, particularly in research and education rankings, with King Abdulaziz University and KAUST leading the region. Research rank was found to have the strongest correlation with overall university rankings, emphasizing its critical role in global positioning. Lastly, China leads Asia in the number of ranked universities, reflecting significant growth in higher education. These insights can guide students, researchers, and policymakers in making informed decisions about academic institutions worldwide.
